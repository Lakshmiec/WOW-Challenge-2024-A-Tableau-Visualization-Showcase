## Challenge Description:
The challenge involves creating a stacked bar chart in Tableau based on the Workout Wednesday challenge #WOW2024 Week 12. The dataset provided is Superstore data. The task is to create a visualization (stacked bar chart) filtered to 2024, split by ship mode, and stacked by month, while also adding total month values. Three different options for creating the visualization are provided: using the analytics pane, using a dual axis, and using dynamic sorting.

## Dataset Description:
The dataset used here is related to sales orders and contains various fields that include order details such as Order ID, Order Date, Ship Date, Ship Mode, Customer Name, Segment, Country/Region, City, State/Province, Postal Code, etc.

## Visualization Description:
The visualization is a stacked bar chart showing the distribution of sales by ship mode over the months of 2024. Each bar represents a month, with segments stacked on top of each other representing different ship modes. The key elements of the chart include stacked bars, tooltips displaying detailed information, labels for the x-axis and y-axis, colored bars representing ship modes, values displaying total sales for each month, a drop-down menu for selecting and sorting ship modes, a hover menu for highlighting ship modes, and a line chart showing the trend in total sales for selected ship modes.
